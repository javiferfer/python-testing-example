# Pytest mocks

Install from Pipfile, if there is one:
```
$ pipenv install
```

Or, add a package to your new project:
```
$ pipenv install <package>
```

This will create a Pipfile if one doesnâ€™t exist. If one does exist, it will automatically be edited with the new package you provided.

Next, activate the Pipenv shell:
```
$ pipenv shell
$ python --version
```

To deactivate the pipenv:
```
deactivate
```

To run the tests:
```
pipenv run pytest
```

- Pipenv install <package> vs pip install <package>

If you are installing using a pipenv environment you should always install your packages using pipenv, this way it will update your pipfile.lock file. Also be careful because pip install <package> will pretty much work anywhere, it's not installing packages to your virtual environment, it's installing them into your computer. Pipenv will update your Pipfile.lock and actually install into your pipenv virtual enviroment if you have one open.

It's rarely a good idea to pip install <package> outside of a virtualenv.
